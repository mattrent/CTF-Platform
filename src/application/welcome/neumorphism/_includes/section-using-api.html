        Welcome to the API section! Here, you can find all the necessary information to get started with our API. Our
        API allows you to interact programmatically with our platform, enabling you to automate tasks, retrieve data,
        and integrate with other systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        To explore the available endpoints and try them out, visit our <a class="highlight-link"
            href="https://{{site.henrik_backend_host}}/swagger/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Swagger
            documentation</a>. The Swagger interface provides a comprehensive overview of all the API endpoints,
        including detailed descriptions, request parameters, and response formats. You can also execute API calls
        directly from the Swagger interface to see how they work.
    </p>

        Additionally, we have a repository filled with challenge examples and their deployment scripts. This repository
        is a great resource for understanding how to use the API in real-world scenarios. You can find the repository at
        <a class="highlight-link" href="https://gitlab.sdu.dk/ctf/ctf_examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CTF
            Examples</a>. The examples provided will help you get started quickly and provide a reference for
        implementing your own solutions.
    </p>

      To help you get started with the API, we have created a Jupyter Notebook that serves as a great starting point. It assembles some of the most useful endpoints and demonstrates how to request and obtain a token for authenticating your requests. You can find the notebook here: <a class="highlight-link" href="https://kianbankelarsen.github.io/CTF-Platform/examples/deployment/notebook.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CTF API Example</a>.
